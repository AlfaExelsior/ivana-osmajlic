## üöÄ Core Features

This project was built from scratch with a focus on modern web technologies and a unique user experience.

*   **Futuristic "Digital Frontier" UI:** A design language inspired by sci-fi HUDs, featuring a grid-based layout, glowing neon accents, and sharp, clean lines.
*   **Context-Aware Avatar Cursor:** A custom-built cursor that changes its avatar based on the section of the site currently in view, reflecting my different professional roles (developer, scholar, business professional).
*   **Dynamic Trail Effect:** The avatar cursor leaves a "glitchy-particle" trail, enhancing the feeling of navigating a digital space.
*   **"Scan-in" Animations:** Elements don't just fade in. Using the `IntersectionObserver` API, UI cards and panels animate their corner brackets as you scroll, creating a "system loading" effect.
*   **Secure Contact Form:** The contact form is powered by Web3Forms and a custom JavaScript implementation. The Access Key is obfuscated using Base64 to prevent scraping by simple bots from this public repository.
*   **Fully Responsive:** The layout is optimized for a seamless experience on all devices, from desktop monitors to mobile phones.
