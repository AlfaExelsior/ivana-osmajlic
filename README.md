## 🚀 Core Features

**From scratch to signature presence** — this portfolio was handcrafted with modern technologies to create a futuristic and engaging user experience.

- **✨ Futuristic "Digital Frontier" UI**  
  A visual language inspired by sci-fi HUDs, featuring grid-based layout, glowing neon accents, and razor-sharp design.

- **🧠 Context-Aware Avatar Cursor**  
  A custom cursor that transforms based on the section you're viewing — representing my roles as a developer, researcher, and strategist.

- **💨 Glitchy Particle Trail**  
  The avatar leaves behind a dynamic particle trail, enhancing the sense of movement through a digital space.

- **📡 Scan-in Animations**  
  Instead of simple fades, UI elements animate in as if the system is loading them in real time using the `IntersectionObserver` API.

- **🛡️ Secure Contact Form**  
  Built with Web3Forms and JavaScript, the access key is obfuscated with Base64 to defend against scraping.

- **📱 Fully Responsive Design**  
  Designed to deliver a seamless experience on any device — mobile, tablet, or desktop.
